# emp-info-backend
Repository to store backend info

## Description

The Employee Management Backend handles API calls and provides data for the frontend of the Employee Management Web Application. It securely retrieves information using an API key stored on Heroku and serves it to the frontend.



To learn more about the frontend part of the project, please visit the [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Aysha-Mohamed/emp-info-frontend).


The backend application uses the following packages:

- **cors:** The `cors` package enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which allows the backend to respond to requests from a different domain (like your frontend). It's important for security and ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend.

- **express:** Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It's used to set up the server, handle routes, and manage requests and responses.
